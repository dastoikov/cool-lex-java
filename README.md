## Dependencies

Minimum Java 8.

Can easily be re-written for lower versions, as primitive iterators and an exact-arithmetic function (in tests) are the sole dependencies on version 8.

## Development

Ideas:

* Additional algorithms as found in the paper.
* Inclusion of testing framework.
* Algorithm implementations for constrained computing environments.
