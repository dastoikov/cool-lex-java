## License

The Cool-lex order and algorithms have been invented by Frank Ruskey and Aaron Williams.
You may need a permission to use Cool-lex, according to applicable laws and academic practices.
In my case, I just asked the authors and got a response back on the same day.

## Dependencies

Minimum Java 8.

Can easily be re-written for lower versions, as primitive iterators and an exact-arithmetic function (in tests) are sole dependencies on version 8.
